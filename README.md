# Cost-Benefit Analysis of Battery Storage for Sustainable Energy Management üåç‚ö°

## Problem Statement
Naomi is a homeowner who uses electricity generated from installed solar panels to meet her immediate needs, reducing her reliance on purchased electricity. However, any excess solar energy generated goes unused, offering no additional savings or income and cannot be utilised when when her demand surpasses generation, requiring her to purchase from the national grid.

In order for her to store excess solar energy for later use, minimizing reliance on purchased electricity, especially during periods of low solar generation, Naomi is considering installing a $7,000 battery with a 20-year lifespan, capable of storing up to 12.5 kWh of electricity.

She has requested an analysis to determine the financial feasibility of a battery installation. Specifically, she needs:
  1. The additional electricity (kWh) that could be utilized with the battery compared to without it.
  2. The corresponding savings in electricity costs (in local currency).
  3. Financial metrics such as Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for two electricity price inflation scenarios:
      1. Government-estimated inflation at 4% annually.
      2. Naomi‚Äôs estimate, starting at 4% annually and increasing by 0.25% each year.
